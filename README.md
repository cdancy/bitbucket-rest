# bitbucket-rest
![alt tag](https://wac-cdn.atlassian.com/dam/jcr:e2a6f06f-b3d5-4002-aed3-73539c56a2eb/bitbucket_rgb_blue.png?cdnVersion=cm)

java client, based on jclouds, to interact with Bitbucket's REST API. 

## Setup and How to use

Client's can be built like so:

      BitbucketClient client = BitbucketClient.builder()
      .endPoint("http://127.0.0.1:7990") // Optional. Defaults to http://127.0.0.1:7990
      .credentials("admin:password") // Optional.
      .build();

      Version version = client.api().systemApi().version();
      
Being built on top of jclouds means things are broken up into [Apis](https://github.com/cdancy/bitbucket-rest/tree/master/src/main/java/com/cdancy/bitbucket/rest/features). 
`Apis` are just Interfaces that are analagous to a resource provided by the server-side program (e.g. /api/branches, /api/pullrequest, /api/commits, etc..). 
The methods within these Interfaces are analagous to an endpoint provided by these resources (e.g. GET /api/branches/my-branch, GET /api/pullrequest/123, DELETE /api/commits/456, etc..). 
The user only needs to be concerned with which `Api` they need and then calling its various methods. These methods, much like any java library, return domain objects 
(e.g. POJO's) modeled after the json returned by `bitbucket`. 

Interacting with the remote service becomes transparent and allows developers to focus on getting things done rather than the internals of the API itself, or how to build a client, or how to parse the json. 
      
## Latest release

Can be sourced from jcenter like so:

	<dependency>
	  <groupId>com.cdancy</groupId>
	  <artifactId>bitbucket-rest</artifactId>
	  <version>0.0.15</version>
	  <classifier>sources|tests|javadoc|all</classifier> (Optional)
	</dependency>
	
## Documentation

javadocs can be found via [github pages here](http://cdancy.github.io/bitbucket-rest/docs/javadoc/)

## Property based setup

Client's do NOT need supply the endPoint or credentials as part of instantiating the BitbucketClient object. 
Instead one can supply them through system properties, environment variables, or a combination 
of the 2. System properties will be searched first and if not found we will attempt to 
query the environment.

Setting the `endpoint` can be done with any of the following (searched in order):

- `bitbucket.rest.endpoint`
- `bitbucketRestEndpoint`
- `BITBUCKET_REST_ENDPOINT`

Setting the `credentials` can be done with any of the following (searched in order):

- `bitbucket.rest.credentials`
- `bitbucketRestCredentials`
- `BITBUCKET_REST_CREDENTIALS`

## Credentials

bitbucket-rest credentials can take 1 of 2 forms:

- Colon delimited username and password: __admin:password__ 
- Base64 encoded username and password: __YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=__ 

## Understanding Error objects

When something pops server-side `bitbucket` will hand us back a list of [Error](https://github.com/cdancy/bitbucket-rest/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cdancy/bitbucket/rest/error/Error.java) objects. Instead of failing and/or throwing an exception at runtime we attach this List of `Error` objects 
to most [domain](https://github.com/cdancy/bitbucket-rest/tree/master/src/main/java/com/cdancy/bitbucket/rest/domain) objects. Thus, it is up to the user to check the handed back domain object to see if the attached List is empty, and if not, iterate over the `Error` objects to see if it's something 
truly warranting an exception. List of `Error` objects itself will always be non-null but in most cases empty (unless something has failed).

An example on how one might proceed:

    PullRequest pullRequest = client.api().pullRequestApi().get("MY-PROJECT", "MY-REPO", 99999);
    if (pullRequest.errors().size() > 0) {
        for(Error error : pullRequest.errors()) {
            if (error.message().matches(".*Pull request \\d+ does not exist in .*")) {
                throw new RuntimeException(error.message());
            }
        }
    }


## Examples

The [mock](https://github.com/cdancy/bitbucket-rest/tree/master/src/test/java/com/cdancy/bitbucket/rest/features) and [live](https://github.com/cdancy/bitbucket-rest/tree/master/src/test/java/com/cdancy/bitbucket/rest/features) tests provide many examples
that you can use in your own code.

## Components

- jclouds \- used as the backend for communicating with Bitbucket's REST API
- AutoValue \- used to create immutable value types both to and from the bitbucket program
    
## Testing

Running mock tests can be done like so:

	./gradlew mockTest
	
Running integration tests can be done like so (requires Bitbucket instance):

	./gradlew integTest
